Working on Ubuntu 20.04 hosted by DigitalOcean. YMMV.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è February 2023 Update ‚ö†Ô∏è
It appears the latest versions of Chrome (110) and undetected-chromedriver (3.4.6) produce invalid header files. [Read this thread for a workaround](https://github.com/byalextran/southwest-headers/issues/6).

## Prerequisites

* python3
* pip3

## Installation

### Install Google Chrome

    wget https://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/pool/main/g/google-chrome-stable/google-chrome-stable_108.0.5359.124-1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_108.0.5359.124-1_amd64.deb

Note: Tested and working with v108. v96 and v110 both don't work, so please make sure Chrome is running on a version that's not too old or new.

### Install Southwest Headers

    git clone https://github.com/byalextran/southwest-headers
    cd southwest-headers

    pip3 install virtualenv
    virtualenv env

    env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

### Updating Southwest Headers    
    cd southwest-headers
    git pull
    rm -rf env
    virtualenv env
    env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

No arguments saves the headers to `southwest_headers.json` in the current directory.

    env/bin/python southwest-headers.py

Include an argument if you want to specify where the headers are saved to.

    env/bin/python southwest-headers.py /PATH/TO/FILENAME.json

The JSON file can then be used in whatever app to auto check-in (assuming the script adds support for reading this file).

I've added support in my script here:

## Add a Cron Job

For now, I'd recommend running this script as a daily cronjob to ensure headers are refreshed regularly. They change periodically, so if this isn't done there's a chance you'll have expired headers when you try to check in.

    crontab -e

And then copy/paste the following at the end of the file (making sure to update it with the *absolute* path):

    0 2 * * *       cd /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/southwest-headers/ && env/bin/python southwest-headers.py

That would run at 2:00am every day with the file `southwest_headers.json` (the default filename) saved in the `southwest-headers` folder.
